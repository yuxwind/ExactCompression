# Exact Compression
[Exact-Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.07804.pdf) is an approach to compress a rectifier network while exactly preserving its underlying functionality with respect to a given input domain if some of its neurons are stable.

## Implementation
We will release the code soon!
